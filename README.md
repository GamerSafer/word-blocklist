# word-blocklist
Sensitive and inappropriate word blocklist for chat filters.

> BE AWARE: The nature of the content of the words in this list may be triggering and uncomfortable, hence why we make them available for you to easily copy into your chat filter tools for preventing their use by members of your community or players in your game.

## Contributing:
**If there are words missing or miscategorized, please consider contributing and adding to the list.**

In the categorized-word-list.csv file you will see several columns:
- "Regex" is where the regex version of the word will go
- Each other column ("racism", "sexism", "swearing", etc..) is a category that the word might fall under. "0" means the word does not match that category, "1" means the word matches that category, and "2" means the word *might* be considered a part of that category or is tangent to that category
